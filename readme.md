Project: Simple Chat Application

Objective:
Develop a client-server chat application where multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages in real-time.

Server Functionality

    1) Accept multiple client connections.
    2) Broadcast messages from one client to all other connected clients.
    3) Handle client disconnections gracefully.

Client functionality:

    1) Connect to the chat server.
    2) Send messages to the server.
    3) Receive and display messages from the server.

Components
Chat Server

    1) Listens for incoming client connections.
    2) Uses a thread pool to manage multiple client connections.
    3) Maintains a list of connected clients.
    4) Broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

Chat Client

    1) Connects to the server using a socket.
    2) Sends messages to the server.
    3) Receives messages from the server and displays them.

Implementation Steps
Create the Chat Server

    1) Use ServerSocket to listen for incoming client connections.
    2) Create a ClientHandler class that implements Runnable to handle each client in a separate thread.
    3) Use synchronized methods to manage shared resources like the list of connected clients.

Create the Chat Client

    1) Use Socket to connect to the server.
    2) Create a thread to listen for incoming messages from the server.
    3) Use BufferedReader and PrintWriter for input and output streams.

Running the Project
Start the Server

    1) Run the ChatServer class.
    2) The server starts listening for client connections on port 12345.

Start the Clients

    1) Run the ChatClient class.
    2) Multiple clients can be started by running the ChatClient class in different terminals or on different machines.

Enhancements

    1) Add a GUI for the client using JavaFX or Swing.
    2) Implement private messaging between clients.
    3) Add authentication and user management features.

This project provides practical experience with Java networking and IO, culminating in a functional chat application.
